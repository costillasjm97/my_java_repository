**LABORATORY ACTIVITY 1**
This Java activity is a simple console-based employee information system. It prompts the user for basic employee details, calculates the employee's daily wage, and demonstrates the use of variables, data types, arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and user input handling in Java.

**LABORATORY ACTIVITY 2**
This Java activity simulates a basic employee information system designed to reinforce key programming concepts. It collects user input, performs string manipulation and arithmetic operations, and outputs formatted employee details such as full name (in uppercase), daily wage, and various salary computations (weekly, monthly, yearly). The program also calculates years until retirement and applies tax and deductions to determine the net annual income.

**LABORATORY ACTIVITY 3**
This Java activity builds upon previous exercises by introducing conditional logic. The program collects employee information, validates input values, and uses if-else statements and switch-case to determine job roles, enforce rules (e.g., age and work hour restrictions), and calculate salary with appropriate tax and deductions. It demonstrates practical use of control structures to manage program flow and handle real-world business rules.

**MIDTERM LABORATORY EXAM**
This Java midterm exam project simulates a basic IT Ticketing System using object-oriented programming and arrays. It allows users to add new tickets, update ticket statuses, view all submitted tickets, and generate a simple report. The activity demonstrates understanding of class creation, conditionals, loops, switch-case statements, and array manipulation.

**LABORATORY ACTIVITY 4**
This Java activity involves creating a simple GUI-based employee information system using AWT. The application collects employee details, calculates the daily wage, and displays the output using appropriate GUI components and layout managers. It also includes basic error handling to manage invalid inputs during runtime, reinforcing studentsâ€™ understanding of GUI programming in Java.

**LABORATORY ACTIVITY 5**
This Java activity is a simple GUI-based quiz application developed using AWT. It displays one multiple-choice computer science question at a time, allows user interaction via radio buttons, and provides feedback on the final score. The program uses arrays, control flow, and event handling with ActionListener, and demonstrates the use of AWT components like Frame, Label, Button, and Panel in a single-window interface.

**LABORATORY ACTIVITY 6** 
This Java activity demonstrates the use of Java Swing to create a simple multi-window To-Do List application. It features two separate windows: a main viewer displaying tasks in a JTable, and a form window for adding new tasks. The app includes text input, a dropdown for task status, and uses ActionListener for event handling. It reinforces skills in GUI layout, window management, and dynamic data updates within a Swing-based application.

**FINAL LABORATORY EXAM**
This Java activity is a basic Calculator application built using AWT or Swing. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through a graphical user interface. The project demonstrates the use of GUI components, layout management, and event handling in Java.
